# File structure
There are many versions of this code. Not all are working.

# Missing file
The code relies on a numerical recipes file romberg_integration.cpp, but I
don't think the license allows me to share that here, so you need to find it
for yourself.

# Getting started
 - Go to the tests/ folder and run make
 - Go to each subdirectory and you should find a bash script that runs a test
   on that particular element
